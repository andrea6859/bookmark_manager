I don’t want to lose time to browse all the links
I’d like to see the list of links from the database on the homepage

As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly find web pages I recently bookmarked
I’d like to see the links in a chronological order

As a curious user
So that I can save the websites that I find useful
I’d like to add new links to my previously added list of links

—

As a dedicated user
So that I organize my links into categories
I’d like to add tags to the links I save

As a competitive user
So that I can find the previously saved links easily
I’d like to filter the links by their tags
